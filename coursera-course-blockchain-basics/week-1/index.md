## Blockchain structure



basic structure of a blockchain. 

- **Transaction** = basic element of the Bitcoin Blockchain. 
  - are validated and broadcast. 
  - Many transactions form a **block**. 
  - Many blocks form a **chain** through a digital data link. 
- **Blocks** 
  - go through a **consensus** process to select the next block that will be added to the chain. 
  - Chosen block is **verified**, and added to the current chain. 
  - **Validation** and **consensus** process are carried out by special peer nodes called **miners**. 
- **miners** = powerful computers executing software defined by the blockchain protocol.

**Unspent Transaction Output**  (**UTXO**)

- fundamental concept of a bitcoin network 

- set of all UTXOs in a bitcoin network collectively define the **state of the Bitcoin Blockchain.** 
- UTXO's are referenced as inputs in a transaction AND  outputs generated by a transaction. 
- All UTXO's in a system, are stored by the participant nodes in a database. 
- role of the UTXO's in a Bitcoin Blockchain. 
  - The transaction uses the amount specified by one or more input UTXOs and transmits it to 1 or +1 new output UTXOs,  according to the request initiated by the sender. 
- The structure of UTXO 
  - unique identifier of the transaction that created this UTXO, 
  - index or the position of the UTXO in the transaction output list
  - a value or the amount it is good for. 
  - an **optional** script,  the condition under which the output can be spent. 



**Transaction (TX)**

- structure

  - includes a reference number of the current transaction
  - references to one no more **input UTXOs** and one or more **output UTXOs** newly generated by the current transaction.
  - the total input amount and output amount. 

- Participants can validate the transaction contents. 

  - *Does the UTXO's reference input exist in the network state?* (a **validation criteria**)

## Basic operations

previously: 

- basics of a blockchain
- basic structure and origin, 

now let's consider the basic operations in a blockchain. 

Operations in the decentralized network 

- the responsibility of the **peer participants** and their respective **computational nodes** (laptop, desktop, and server racks).
- operations include 
  - **validation transactions** 
  - **gathering the transactions for a block** [2]
  - **broadcasting** the ballot transactions in the block [3]
  - **consensus** on the next block creation [4]
  - **chaining** the blocks to form an **immutable record**. 
- participants in operations 
  - 2 major roles
    - **transferring participants** => initiate transfer of value by creating a **transaction**
    - **miners** mining  => take on added work or computation
      - verify transactions 
      - broadcast transaction [3]
      - compete to claim the right to create a block [2]
      - work on reaching consensus by validating the block [4]
      - broadcasting the newly created block
      - confirming transactions. 
  - why do participant take on additional work?  **incentivised** with bitcoins for the efforts in managing the blockchain
  - Transaction validation is carried out independently by all miners.  The process involves validation of more than 20 criteria, including size, syntax, et cetera.  Some of these criteria are: 
    - Referenced input UTXOs are valid, 
    - Reference output UTXOs are correct, 
    - reference input amount and output amount matched sufficiently,

> This creates a challenge => If every miner adds the block to the chain => many branches to the chain => inconsistent state. 
>
> Recall, the blockchain is a single consistent linked chain of flux. 
>
> We need a system to overcome this challenge, the solution.  Miners compete to solving a puzzle to determine who has the right to create the next block.

> Currently, the minor's fees is 12.5 BTC for a bitcoin. 



## Beyond Bitcoin



Bitcoin blockchain is open-source and the entire code is available on the GitHub.  During the initial years beginning roughly in 2009,  this open-source code was extended to release different cryptocurrencies.  About 300 plus cryptocurrencies were introduced. 

Bitcoin supports an optional and special feature called **scripts** for conditional transfer of values.  Ethereum Blockchain extended the scripting feature into  a full-blown code execution framework called smart contract. A smart contract provide the very powerful **capability of code execution for embedding business logic on the blockchain.** 

Based on such capabilities, three major types of blockchains emerge from Bitcoin foundation. 

- Type one deals with the coins in cryptocurrency currency chain. Example, Bitcoin. 
- Type two supports cryptocurrency and a business logic layer supported by code execution.  Example, ethereum. 
- Type three involves no currency but supports software execution for business logic.  Example, The Linux Foundation's Hyperledger. 



With the addition of code execution,  comes the serious consideration about public access to the blockchain hence, 

the classification of public, private, and permissioned blockchains based on access limits. 



We have been watching Bitcoin blockchain continuously operational since its inception.  All supported by its public participants.  Thus Bitcoin is a fantastic example of a public blockchain class.  Anybody can join and leave as they wish. Transaction blocks and the blockchain are publicly observable even though participants are anonymous.  It is open-source. 

You can also create new coin digital currency by modifying the Bitcoin code. Wallet applications provide the basic interface to transfer value through the Bitcoin blockchain. 

In a private blockchain,  access to the blockchain is limited to selected participants for example,  those participants within an organization.  This restriction helps in simplifying  the normal operations such as block creation and contingence model. 

The third classification of blockchain is permissioned blockchain,  also called consortium blockchain.  It is meant for a consortium of collaborating parties to transact on a blockchain for ease of governance, provenance,  and accountability for example,  a consortium of all automobile companies or health-care organizations.  Permissioned blockchain has the benefits of a public blockchain  with allowing only users with permission to collaborate and transact. 

In summary, significant innovations such as smart  contracts have opened up broader applications for blockchain technology  Private and permissioned blockchain allow for  controlled access to the blockchain enabling many diverse business models.
